%this function learns the CSP (Common Spatial Patterns) filters to
%discriminate two mental states in EEG signals
%
%Input:
%EEGSignals: the training EEG signals, composed of 2 classes. These signals
%are a structure such that:
%   EEGSignals.x: the EEG signals as a [Ns * Nc * Nt] Matrix where
%       Ns: number of EEG samples per trial
%       Nc: number of channels (EEG electrodes)
%       nT: number of trials
%   EEGSignals.y: a [1 * Nt] vector containing the class labels for each trial
%   EEGSignals.s: the sampling frequency (in Hz)
%
%Output:
%CSPMatrix: the learnt CSP filters (a [Nc*Nc] matrix with the filters as rows)
